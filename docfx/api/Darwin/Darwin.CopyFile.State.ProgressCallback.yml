  summary: Signature for the method that will be invoked during a recursive copy operation.
  remarks: >-
    The fist parameter identifies the kind of progress being reported,
                  the second parameter the state of that particular process, then
                  the source and destiation file names as well as the State object that can
                  be used to inspect the state of the operation.   The method must return
                  an action in the form of a NextStep value to indicate what course of
                  action to take (continue, skip, cancel).
